# Worker Management App

The Worker Management App is a web application built with Django that allows administrators to manage workers and users. Administrators can create, edit, update, and delete worker profiles. Users can view the list of workers, rate them, and report any issues to the administrators. The app also supports different roles such as admin, manager, and user, each with specific permissions.
